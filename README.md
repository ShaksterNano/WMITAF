# What Mod Is This Enchantment From?

A client-side addon for the Fabric mods [WTHIT](https://github.com/badasintended/wthit "What The Hell Is That?") and [REI](https://github.com/shedaniel/RoughlyEnoughItems "Roughly Enough Items") that shows the name of the mod that adds an enchantment in the tooltip of an enchanted book instead of "Minecraft".

Requires WTHIT v3.11.0 or above and/or REI v6.1.315 or above.
